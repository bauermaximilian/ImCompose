## Installation
### As toolbar item
Download the [script](./ImCompose.jsx) and put it into the startup scripts folder, which usually can be found at `%appdata%\Adobe\InDesign\Version 14.0\de_DE\Scripts\Startup Scripts` for Windows users. After restarting InDesign, you should see it as a new menu item in the "File">"New" submenu.
### As normal script
Download the [script](./ImCompose.jsx) and put it into the script panel folder, which usually can be found at `%appdata%\Adobe\InDesign\Version 14.0\de_DE\Scripts\Scripts Panel` for Windows users. 
After restarting InDesign, you should see it in the scripts panel.

## Features and Bugs
The script detects the language of your installation and will then either be displayed in English (default) or German. If you want that plugin in your language, feel free to contact me and we'll make it happen! 

This was a small project I created to help me doing this very repetitive task faster. It was now used for over a month and didn't fail or expose any unexpected behaviour, but it wasn't tested beyond my default use cases - so if you find any bugs, let me know.

There are still some features and ideas not implemented - if there's the demand for some of them or new ideas arise and I got time, I'll take care of that.
